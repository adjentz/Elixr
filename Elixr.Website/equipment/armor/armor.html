            Armor
        </h2>
        <p>
            Armor is worn by characters to increase their Defense, making them less likely to be hit.
            Armor descriptions include: Bestows Disadvantage, Speed Penalty, and Don Time.

        <h3>
            Bestows Disadvantage
        </h3>
        <p>
            Wearing Armor that is 45 pounds or more causes some skills to have Disadvantage due to the armor's awkwardness. 
            These skills include: Athletics, Acrobatics, Climb, Swim, and Stealth 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Speed Penalty
        </h3>
        <p>
            Some Armor is hard to move in. While wearing such Armor, your Movement Speed is reduced by the Speed Penalty.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Don Time
        </h3>
        <p>
            Armor takes time to put on. The Don Time is how many rounds it takes to fully put on armor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The time it takes to remove armor is half of the Don Time.
