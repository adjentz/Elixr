            Armor
        </h2>
        <p>
            Armor is worn by characters to increase their Defense, making them less likely to be hit.
            Armor descriptions include: Is Cumbersome and Don Time.  
        </p>
        <h3>
            Is Cumbersome
        </h3>
        <p>
            When worn, some armor causes some skills to have Disadvantage due to the armor's weight or awkwardness. 
            These skills include: Athletics, Acrobatics, Climb, Swim, and Stealth 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Don Time
        </h3>
        <p>
            Armor takes time to put on. The Don Time is how many rounds it takes to fully put on armor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The time it takes to remove armor is half of the Don Time.
