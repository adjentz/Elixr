            Magic
        </h2>
        <p>
            Magic is the ability to channel Energy into physical manifestations of power.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most common form of Magic is Spells, which use the Energy of the caster.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Learning a spell
        </h3>
        <p>
            Any character can learn spells, but they <strong>must</strong> provide a reason for how or why they learned magic.
            Some common examples are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You studied in the Mage College, poring over spell books, where you wrote down interesting ones in a book of your own, which
                    you study and keep updated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your bloodline has intristically been able to tap into mystical forces and gain power naturally.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You made a deal with a supernatural beast for power in exchange for your allegiance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A deity you worship grants you the ability to channel their power as long as you spread word of their deeds.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each spell a character learns costs 1 Feature Point.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some characters, as a trait, have difficulty tapping into Magic. You decide if you want your character to fall into this
            category by not having them learn any spells.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Casting a spell
        </h3>
        <p>
            All spells require the caster to say specific, arcane, words, and move their hands to direct the Energy. Spells have the
            following components: <strong>Speed Cost</strong>, <strong>Energy Cost</strong>, <strong>Regen Time</strong>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Speed Cost
        </h4>
        <p>
            Speed Cost is how much of your turn's movement Speed is consumed in order to cast the spell. If a spell has a Speed Cost
            higher than your character's Speed, this means it will take more than 1 round to cast the spell.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Energy Cost
        </h4>
        <p>
            When casting a spell, you must declare how much Energy you are using to cast it. This is referred to as your "Channeled Energy",
            which cannot exceed your character's Current Energy. Channeled Energy is recorded on your character sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Energy Cost of a spell indicates how much Energy must be channeled in order to produce an effect. Typically, the more Energy channeled,
            the more powerful the spell becomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having Channeled Energy carries a certain risk. If a character with Channeled Energy takes damage, the following occurs:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The character loses Energy from the damage as normal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, the character loses Energy equal to the amount of Channeled Energy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any spells still in effect from the Channeled Energy immediately stop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The character's Channeled Energy is reset to 0.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For these reasons, it is recommended for spell casters to stay away from melee combat when possible.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Regen Time
        </h4>
        <p>
            Regen Time is how long it takes for Channeled Energy to return to 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, a character might cast Energy Blast by Channeling four points of Energy, which they record on their character
            sheet. Energy Blast has a Regen Time of 1 round, so at the start of the character's next turn, their Channeled
            Energy returns to 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a spell has a Regen Time of 2 rounds, it won't be at the start of the character's next turn, but instead the start of
            their turn after that, in which their Channeled Energy returns to 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some spells have a Regen Time of "Concentration". 
            This means the spell will stay in effect until a character stops concentrating on it, either by becoming a distracted and failing a Concentration check, or by declaring that they want the spell to end.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, Channeled Energy resets to 0 at the start of the character's next turn.
