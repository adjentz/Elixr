            Magic
        </h2>
        <p>
            Magic is the ability to channel Energy into physical manifestations of power.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most common form of Magic is Spells, which use the Energy of the caster.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Learning a spell
        </h3>
        <p>
            Any character can learn spells, but they <strong>must</strong> provide a reason for how or why they learned magic.
            Some common examples are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You studied in the Mage College, poring over spell books, where you wrote down interesting ones in a book of your own, which
                    you study and keep updated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your bloodline has intristically been able to tap into mystical forces and gain power naturally.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You made a deal with a supernatural beast for power in exchange for your allegiance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A deity you worship grants you the ability to channel their power as long as you spread word of their deeds.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each spell a character learns costs 1 Feature Point.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some characters, as a trait, have difficulty tapping into Magic. You decide if you want your character to fall into this
            category by not having them learn any spells.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Casting a spell
        </h3>
        <p>
            You have a number of spell slots equal to your Focus Modifier. If your Focus Modifier is 0 or less, you cannot cast spells.
        </p>
        <p>
            You cast a spell by placing it in a free spell slot on your turn. If no spell slots are free, you cannot cast any additional spells.
            These Spell Slots are noted in the Spell Slots section of your Character Sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            To place a spell in a spell slot, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Choose a free spell slot and write down the name of a spell that you have learned in the "Spell Name" column. This causes the slot to no longer be free.
            </li>
            <li>
                Choose how much Energy you want to channel for the spell, record this number in the "Channeled Energy" column, then add the number to the Total Channeled section of your Character Sheet. See notes about Channeled Energy below.
            </li>
            <li>
                Record how many rounds it will take to regain this Channeled Energy, as noted by the "Regen Time" of the spell description, in the "Regen Left" column.
                If the Regen Time listed is "Concentration", simply mark an <i class="fa fa-times"></i> in this spot instead.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            At the start of each of your turns, do the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Subtract 1 from the "Regen Left" column for each spell that is not Concentration based. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If the number in the "Regen Left" column becomes 0 after performing the previous step, decrease the Total Channeled by the number in the Channeled Energy column.
                Then, erase the row, making the spell slot free.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            For concentration spells, at any point on your turn you may decide to stop concentrating on the spell. 
            In which case, decrease the Total Channeled by the number in the Channeled Energy column, then erase the row, thus freeing the spell slot.
            Any effects from the spell immediately cease.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Channeled Energy
        </h4>
        <p>
            All spells have a description for "Energy Cost", which indicates how much Energy must be channeled in order to produce an effect. 
            Typically, the more Energy channeled, the more powerful the spell becomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you place a spell in a spell slot, you determine how much of your own Energy you are willing risk on this spell, and record it in the "Channeled Energy" column.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sum of the "Channeled Energy" column of every spell, in other words, the "Total Channeled" in the Spell Slots section, cannot exceed your Current Energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your Current Energy goes down, such as for taking damage from an attack, the following happens:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Your Current Energy is decreased by the Total Channeled in the Spell Slots section.
            </li>
            <li>
                All spells are erased from the Spell Slots, freeing all of them. Any effects still in play from those spells cease immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
                As a result, Total Channeled is set to 0.
            </li>
        </ol>
