            Flaws
        </h2>
        <p>
            Flaws are traits that detract from a character's effectiveness or personality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some Flaws have positive trade offs. 
            For example, a blind character has Advantage on Perception checks that relate to sound, at the cost of being unable to make Perception checks based off of sight at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other Flaws serve simply to make a character more interesting. Characters that are perfect are often seen as unrealistic, or worse, boring.
