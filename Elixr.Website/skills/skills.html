        <h2>
            Skills
        </h2>
        <p>
            Skills indicate how adept or well trained your character is at performing a certain action. Each Skill is detailed below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Skills have four parts: Ranks, Modifier, Misc., and Bonus.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Ranks
        </h3>
        <p>
            You determine how versatile you want your character to be at a Skill by placing points in the ranks column.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you first create your character, each rank starts at 0. You then have a pool of 8 Points to distribute between all
            of the Skills. To increase a rank by one, you reduce the pool by one, until the remaining Skill points is zero.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ranks for a Skill can go no higher than your character's level + 3
        </p>
        <h3>
            Modifier
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Skill modifier is carried down from the relevant ability modifier. If your Strength Modifier is 3, for example, all of the Skills
            in the Strength section have a modifier of 3. The same follows for the other abilities.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Misc.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Various Features and magical items can give a Misc. bonus to specific Skills. This is added to the Misc. bonus of the relevent Ability.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Bonus
        </h3>
        <p>
            The sum of Ranks, Modifier, and Misc..
        </p>

        <h2>
            Making a Skill check
        </h2>
        <p>
            Your GM may call for a Skill check to be rolled when you attempt an action related to that Skill.
        </p>
        <p>
            To roll a Skill check, take the result of 1d20 + Skill Bonus. Your GM will tell you if the result is high enough to perform
            the action you were attempting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of if the check succeeds or not, the Speed cost, if any, is applied fully.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Criticaling
        </h3>
        <p>
            When rolling 1d20, if the result of the roll is 20 before any other modifiers are applied, this is referred to as a critical.
        </p>
        <p>
            A critical indicates an automatic success, as long as the GM rules that the action isn't physically impossible, and that
            you have the necessary equipment, if any.
        </p>
        <p>
            A critical also means that you performed the action so effectively, that you can add a flourish to the action for flavor,
            if desired.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Fumbling
        </h3>
        <p>
            <p>
                When rolling 1d20, if the result of the roll is 1 before any other modifiers are applied, this is referred to as a fumble.
            </p>
            <p>
                A fumble indicates an automatic failure, but <strong>only</strong> if a creature is under pressure, such
                as a combat situation. Otherwise, the roll is added normally.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a fumble, you can still continue your turn, even to retry the check, as long as you have enough Speed remaining to do so.
            </p>
