            Oaths
        </h2>
        <p>
            Oaths are a creed, or set of beliefs, that a character believes in strongly enough that to not follow them would be detrimental to the psyche of the character.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Most Oaths give a character's benefits, so as long as the character actively upholds the Oath.

        <p>
            The punishment for a character breaking an Oath varies by GM. The recommended punishment is to not allow a character to level until they have properly atoned for the oath they broke.
