You assume the form of a specific creature, using their stats in place of your own.

Your Current Energy becomes the Max Energy of the new form, or whatever your Current Energy is, whichever is lower.

Energy channeled must be equal to the Level of the desired creature.  

If you take damage while in your new form, channeled Energy is lost as normal, but the spell doesn't automatically end as normal.
You may choose to stay in your wild shape. If your Current Energy is brought to 0 or below, you are forced into your original form.

Any gear melds into your new form.

If your new form cannot vocalize, you cannot cast spells requiring vocalization.
If your new form does not have fingers, you cannot cast spells requiring hand movement.

The spell can be learned multiple times, but each time a different creature is specified.
