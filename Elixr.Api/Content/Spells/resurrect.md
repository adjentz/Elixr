You bring a creature that has died back to life.

The creature’s Max Energy becomes the Energy that you spend on casting this spell, or what the creature’s Max Energy was while they were alive, whichever is lower.

When the spell is cast, you enter a deathlike, catatonic state in which you go limp and become unaware of your surroundings for an equal length of time as the creature being resurrected was dead, after which your Channeled Energy is reset to 0 as though the Regen Time had fully elapsed.

Once this time has elapsed, both you and the target come to life.
