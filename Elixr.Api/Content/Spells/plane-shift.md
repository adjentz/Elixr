You change what plane of existence youâ€™re on.

What planes exist in the world is determined by your GM, but typically include the Material Plane, Ethereal Plane, Water Plane, Earth Plane, Fire Plane, Air Plane, Celestial Plane, and Infernal Plane.

These are described on the Running the Game page. At the end of the spell you return to the same location on the plane you left from.
