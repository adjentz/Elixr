You move an object or creature with your mind.


If using an Telekinesis to hurl an object at a creature, roll a spell attack. 
If the result exceeds the target's Defense, they take damage as indicated by the dice roll column of this table:

|Energy Channeled|Object Weight|Dice Roll|
|---|---|---|
|1|Up to 10lbs|1d4|
|2|Up to 20lbs|2d4|
|3|Up to 30lbs|3d4|
|4|Up to 40lbs|4d4|
|5|Up to 50lbs|5d4|
|etc...|etc...|etc...|

How large of an object can be lifted is given by the table as well and is proportional to the Energy channeled.

When using Telekinesis to move a creature, no dice roll is made. Instead, if dropped, they take normal damage as though they had fell.

The Regen Time is 1 round for every 30ft the object or creature travels.
