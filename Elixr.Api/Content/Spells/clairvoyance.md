You're able to seen and hear people & places that you are familiar with, regardless of your distance from them.

Using Clairvoyance to see a person is referred to as Scrying.

When using Clairvoyance to scry, the Energy channeled must exceed their Concentration Defense.
If Energy channeled is not greater than their Concentration Defense, Scrying reveals only a white outline of the person.

If a person being scryed is in a location unfamiliar to you, the background of the person and surrounding area appears completely black.
