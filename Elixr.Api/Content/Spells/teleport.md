You teleport to a specified location.

The location can either be a specific place, or a specified distance and direction from where you are.

If you cannot see or have never been to the destination, there's a chance of ending up in a wall or object.

This depends on how much "clutter" is at the destination, as determined by the GM.
For example, the GM may say something like "There's a 30% chance you'll end up in something." 
In this case, you must roll a percentile. If the result is 30% or less, you are immediately shunted to the nearest open square,
and you lose your channeled Energy as though you had been hit by an attack.

You can bring other creatures, so long as they are all connected through touch.

If a creature is unwilling, you must make a spell attack. If the result exceeds the target's Concentration Defense, they are forced to teleport regardless.
