You're able to discern information that is yet to occur. 

Because the feature is fluid, information you see is foggy, unclear and vague.

To divinate the outcome of a specific event depends on how complex the event's circumstances are.
The GM sets a Difficulty using the following as a guideline:

|Simple|Complex|Enigmatic|
|---|---|---|
|20|30|60|

Accurate divination takes time. For each minute that is spent concentrating, the Difficulty is lowered by 1.
The Energy used on the spell must exceed the Difficulty in order for useul information to be conveyed.

If, while concentrating on the spell, you are touching a reflective surface, such as a pool or mirror, the images you receive can be cast on them. 

Just because you divinate an event does not mean it is certain to occur, just that it seems likely at the time that the divination was performed.
