You tell a creature a command which they must obey.

To succesfully Compel a creature, roll 1d6 per Energy channeled. If the result of the attack is greater than the target's Concentration Defense, they are compelled.

If the command involves having the target injure themselves or those they care about, their effective Concentration Defense is increased by 5 for the sake of this spell.

If you lose your Channeled Energy for any reason, such as from taking damage, the spell ends immediately, even if the target has not completed their command.

If the target loses Energy, the spell ends immediately.

A creature can only have one command compelled on them at a time. To chain commands, Compel must be cast again.
