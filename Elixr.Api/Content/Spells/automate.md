You specify a trigger and a certain action automatically occurs.

Examples include: "When a creature walks next to the door, the door automatically opens." Or, "After I dictate what to write, this quill will ink it to the paper."

You cannot automate an object to perform an action that it would be incapable of doing manually. 

This spell has no effect on living creatures.
