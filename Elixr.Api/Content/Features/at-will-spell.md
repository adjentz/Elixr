Choose a spell that you already know. 

By permanently sacrificing Energy up to the amount the spell allows, multiplied by the Spell's regen time in rounds, you are able to cast that spell without needing to channel Energy for it.

For spells with a Concentration based Regen Time, this spell can only be cast using this Feature once each day.
The spell can, however, be cast at anytime as normal, by channeling Energy for it.

Speed Cost to cast remains the same, and unless otherwise specified, still requires hand movements and vocalization as normal.
