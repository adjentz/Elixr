### Physical Description
Standing a foot or two lower than the average human, Dwarves are known for stout features and, in males, their long beards. What they lack in height, they make up for in sheer muscle and build, weighing similar to a typical sized human of the same gender.


They often have darker, earth-tone skin, but pale-skin is not unheard of. Black, red, or brown hair or beards, is common, with a hint of grey appearing in older dwarves.

### Culture
Dwarves value treasure & kin. Often thought to be greedy, they simply value fine craftsmanship and the riches the earth provides. Theyâ€™re a proud people, with a full history. They are most comfortable in the mountains, where they make their homes.

### Sample Names
