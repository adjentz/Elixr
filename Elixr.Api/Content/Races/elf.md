### Physical Description
Slender and poised is what most other races think of first when elves come to mind. About the same in height to most humans, elves are much more slim, weighing as little as 25% less than a human of the same gender and approximate height. Owing to this combination of height and weight, elves are known for their agility and grace.


With pointed ears, hairless skin that is pale or bronze, and a variety of majestic eye and hair colors, other races can’t help but find them captivating.

### Culture
Elves are immune to natural causes of death, such as old age — though they can still die by the sword, or poison, for example. This distances them from the mortal races, with their petty squabbles, leaving elves to focus on their art, music, and other workmanship. This often makes them seem haughty to the other races, but despite this, the company of elves is highly sought after for the quality of their songs, magic, and poetry.
