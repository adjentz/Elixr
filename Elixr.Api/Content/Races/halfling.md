### Physical Description
And what is a Halfling? Being half as tall as a human, that being their namesake, some might expect that them to weigh half as much as well; they’d be correct if it weren’t for the fact that halflings love their meals, and tend to have a round belly and 20 pounds extra for it.


Sporting wavy brown hair, both on their heads and on their feet (which are leathery enough to not require shoes), halflings have eye colors to match the hills and earth they live near, and pale to sun-tanned skin.

### Culture
Nice music, good company, and great food are the things a halfling lives for. They prefer to stay home next to their warm fires, but will help help friends with the need arises.
